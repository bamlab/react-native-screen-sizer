# ReactNative Screen Sizer

Quickly check how your app looks on different screen sizes.

<img src="./assets/demo.gif" alt="Live demo of the usage of the library" width="300" />

## Installation

```sh
yarn add react-native-screen-sizer
```

You'll also need to have these dependencies installed:

- if you use `expo go`:
  ```bash
  npx expo install react-native-safe-area-context
  ```
- if you use `expo` with a custom build:
  ```bash
  npx expo install react-native-safe-area-context expo-dev-client
  ```
- if you use a bare React Native project:
  ```bash
  yarn add react-native-safe-area-context
  npx pod-install
  ```

Then, add it to `App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

// üëã Add the import
import * as ScreenSizer from 'react-native-screen-sizer';

// üëã Call this at the top-level of App.tsx. It will handle some things like register shortcuts in the dev menu.
ScreenSizer.setup();

export const App = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider>
      <ScreenSizer.Wrapper
        devices={[
          ScreenSizer.defaultDevices.iPhoneSE2016,
          {
            name: 'Custom Device',
            width: 200,
            height: 400,
            insets: { top: 20, bottom: 20 },
          },
        ]}
      >
        {/* üëã `ScreenSizer.Wrapper` must be inserted inside `SafeAreaProvider` but **around** any provider or component that uses safe area dimensions */}
        {/* The rest of your providers and your app */}
      </ScreenSizer.Wrapper>
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  );
};
```

**NOTE**: The `Wrapper` and the setup function are no-ops in release builds,
so you can safely add them without adding `__DEV__` conditions yourself.

## Usage

- We recommend using a big screen (eg `iPhone 14 Pro Max`) as the "base device"
  to develop on.
- The `Wrapper` prop `devices` (optional) is the list of devices you want to emulate. You can find
  the available devices in `ScreenSizer.defaultDevices`, or pass a custom size.
  By default, the list `ScreenSizer.defaultDevices.all` is used.
- To toggle the Screen Sizer:

  - Open the dev menu (<kbd>‚åò cmd</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> on iOS or
    <kbd>‚åò cmd</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Android)
    and tap `"üìê¬†Toggle Screen Sizer"`
  - **OR** import the function `ScreenSizer.toggleScreenSizer()` in your code
    and link it to a button to activate the screen sizer!
  - Compatibility of each feature by project type:

    |                        | React Native Dev Menu | Expo Dev Menu | `toggle` function |
    | ---------------------- | :-------------------: | :-----------: | :---------------: |
    | Bare React Native      |          ‚úÖ           |      ‚ùå       |        ‚úÖ         |
    | Expo Go                |          ‚ùå           |      ‚ùå       |        ‚úÖ         |
    | Expo Custom Dev Client |          ‚úÖ           |      ‚úÖ       |        ‚úÖ         |

- You can navigate between the different devices with the arrows on the top left
  of the screen sizer.

## Making it work well

Things should be mostly ok without changing anything in your app code, but you can get better fidelity (and by the way handle screen resizing on device like iPad better) by following these guidelines:

### Read screen / window / safe area dimensions through `react-native-safe-area-context`

- ‚ùå `import { SafeAreaView, useWindowDimensions } from "react-native"`
- ‚úÖ `import { SafeAreaView, useSafeAreaInsets, useSafeAreaFrame } from "react-native-safe-area-context"`

react-native-screen-sizer adds a custom react-native-safe-area-context provider to emulate the safe area insets and frame of the "sized device".
Currently, other ways to read these dimensions (like the ones in the base `react-native` package) are not supported.

### Always read screen / window / safe area dimensions in a reactive manner

- ‚ùå `import { Dimensions¬†} from "react-native`
- ‚ùå `import { initialMetrics¬†} from "react-native-safe-area-context"`
- ‚úÖ `import { SafeAreaView, useSafeAreaInsets, useSafeAreaFrame } from "react-native-safe-area-context"`

If you use "static" dimensions, you app won't re-render properly when the device size changes. This applies to the "emulated size" from this package, but also to the real size (eg window resizing on iPad or M1 macs, or switching to landscape mode), so it's a good thing to do anyway!

### Eslint config

You can setup these eslint rules to enforce some of the guidelines above:

```json
{
  "no-restricted-imports": [
    "error",
    {
      "paths": [
        {
          "name": "react-native",
          "importNames": ["Dimensions", "useWindowDimensions"],
          "message": "Read dimensions with `useSafeAreaFrame` from `react-native-safe-area-context` instead (to support screen-sizer)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Current limitations

- **Landscape mode** is not supported
- On android, the **status bar** inset is applied as if the status bar is visible and translucent
- If the "base device" is smaller than the "sized screen", behavior is undefined
