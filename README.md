# ReactNative Screen Sizer

Quickly check how your app looks on different screen sizes.

## Installation

Currently, screen-sizer will only work with expo projects.

```sh
yarn add react-native-screen-sizer
```

You'll need to have the `react-native-safe-area-context` dependency installed:

```
npx expo install react-native-safe-area-context
```

Then, add it to `App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

// üëã Add the import
import * as ScreenSizer from 'react-native-screen-sizer';

// üëã Call this at the top-level of App.tsx. It will handle some things like patching keyboard events.
ScreenSizer.setup();

export const App = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider>
      <ScreenSizer.Wrapper device={ScreenSizer.deviceSizes['iPhone SE 2016']}>
        {/* üëã `ScreenSizer.Wrapper` must be inserted inside `SafeAreaProvider` but **around** any provider or component that uses safe area dimensions */}
        {/* The rest of your providers and your app */}
      </ScreenSizer.Wrapper>
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  );
};
```

**NOTE**: The `Wrapper` and the setup function are no-ops in release builds, so you can safely add them without adding `__DEV__` conditions yourself.

## Usage

- The `Wrapper` prop `device` is the device you want to emulate. You can find the list of available devices in `ScreenSizer.deviceSizes`. You can also pass a custom device size object.
- `device` is optional. If you don't pass it, an `iPhone SE 2016` size will be used.
- We recommend using a big screen (eg `iPhone 14 Pro Max`) as the "base device" to develop on.
- To toggle the Screen Sizer:
  - If you use expo, open the expo dev menu (<kbd>‚åò cmd</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>) and tap `"üìê Toggle Screen Sizer"` (you'll need to have `expo-dev-menu` installed in your project)
  - **OR** if you don't use expo, open the react native dev menu (<kbd>‚åò cmd</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>) and tap `"üìê Toggle Screen Sizer"`
  - **OR** import the function `ScreenSizer.toggleIsEnabled()` in your code and link it to a button to activate the screen sizer!

## Making it work well

Things should be mostly ok without changing anything in your app code, but you can get better fidelity (and by the way handle screen resizing on device like iPad better) by following these guidelines:

### Read screen / window / safe area dimensions through `react-native-safe-area-context`

- ‚ùå `import { SafeAreaView, useWindowDimensions } from "react-native"`
- ‚úÖ `import { SafeAreaView, useSafeAreaInsets, useSafeAreaFrame } from "react-native-safe-area-context"`

react-native-screen-sizer adds a custom react-native-safe-area-context provider to emulate the safe area insets and frame of the "sized device".
Currently, other ways to read these dimensions (like the ones in the base `react-native` package) are not supported.

### Always read screen / window / safe area dimensions in a reactive manner

- ‚ùå `import { Dimensions¬†} from "react-native`
- ‚ùå `import { initialMetrics¬†} from "react-native-safe-area-context"`
- ‚úÖ `import { SafeAreaView, useSafeAreaInsets, useSafeAreaFrame } from "react-native-safe-area-context"`

If you use "static" dimensions, you app won't re-render properly when the device size changes. This applies to the "emulated size" from this package, but also to the real size (eg window resizing on iPad or M1 macs, or switching to landscape mode), so it's a good thing to do anyway!

### Eslint config

You can setup these eslint rules to enforce some of the guidelines above:

```json
{
  "no-restricted-imports": [
    "error",
    {
      "paths": [
        {
          "name": "react-native",
          "importNames": ["Dimensions", "useWindowDimensions"],
          "message": "Read dimensions with `useSafeAreaFrame` from `react-native-safe-area-context` instead (to support screen-sizer)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Current limitations

- **Landscape mode** is not supported
- On android, the **status bar** inset is applied as if the status bar is visible and translucent
- **Keyboard insets** emulation is very experimental, don't trust it too much
- If the "base device" is smaller than the "sized screen", behavior is undefined
